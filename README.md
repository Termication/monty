Monty is a programming language that is designed to be very simple and easy to understand. It is often used as a teaching tool for beginners learning about programming concepts such as data structures and algorithms. Monty is also commonly used in coding challenges and competitions.

The syntax of Monty is straightforward, and it typically uses a stack-based approach to evaluate expressions. This means that operations are performed on a stack data structure, where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

Monty programs are typically written in plain text files with the .m extension. These files contain sequences of Monty commands and instructions that are executed by an interpreter.
